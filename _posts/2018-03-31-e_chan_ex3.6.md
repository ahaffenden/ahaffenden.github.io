Quantitative Trading: example 3.6 Pairs trading with GLD and GDX
----------------------------------------------------------------

This example illustrates how to separate the data into a training set and a test set.

We will backtest a pair-trading strategy and optimize its parameters on the training set and look at the effect on the test set. GLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD reflects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining stocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.

E. Chan states that he has discussed this pair of ETFs extensively on his blog in connection with cointegration analysis (see, e.g., epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/reader-suggested-possible-trading.html).

Cointegration analysis on the training set is covered in Chapter 7 of the book and is used to determine if the spread formed by long GLD and short GDX is mean reverting. In this example we will perform a regression analysis on the training set to determine the hedge ratio between GLD and GDX, and then define entry and exit thresholds for a pair-trading strategy. We will see how optimising these thresholds on the training set changes the performance on the test set.

We will use a function, lag1, to lag the time series by one time period.
